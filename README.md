## Chip 8 Interpreter

A chip 9 interpreter written in Rust. Built by referencing Cowgod's great chip-8 reference found here: http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM.

As of right now this is still WIP

#### Background
Went down an emulator rabbit hole, someone mentioned chip-8 and it seemed like a fun project to learn a bit about emulators, op codes and some computer concepts I wasn't very familiar with.
